## Windows 11 Dual Boot

This is essentially a personal reference for dual-booting Windows 11 with Arch Linux for me, but I've made it public for everyone. This guide is designed to give you a minimalistic Arch Linux *BASE* system. There won't be a fancy desktop after this is done. I'm working on that [here](https://github.com/itsmicah722/.dots.git). 

- The [Pre-Installation](docs/dual_boot_win11/pre_installation.md) covers the prerequisites needed to boot into the Arch Linux Live ISO Environment. 

- The [Installation](docs/dual_boot_win11/installation.md) covers the core installation of the Arch Linux Base System and offers a minimalistic setup.
